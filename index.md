<h2>A. California Community Foundation</h2>
For more than a century, the California Community Foundation has worked to transform generosity into impact and improve the quality of life for all Los Angeles County residents. Since 1915, the foundation has empowered donors to pursue their own philanthropic passions and to collaborate with us in addressing the root causes of the county’s most pressing issues, including the arts, civic engagement, education, economic opportunity, health, housing, immigrant integration, nonprofit sustainability, smart growth and youth empowerment. The California Community Foundation stewards nearly $1.5 billion in assets and manages more than 1,600 foundations, funds and legacies. You can find out more about us at [www.calfund.org](http://www.calfund.org/). 

<h2>B. The Social Change Data Commons project</h2>

<h3>1. The Problem – The hidden needs of L.A. County</h3>
One of the greatest dangers facing Los Angeles County is how little we know about it, and how this is affecting what we do to help it. 

L.A. County is spread over more than 4,000 sq. miles, and is home to over 10 million residents, spread between 88 cities and 81 different school districts. It is a maze of bureaucracy, with hundreds of disconnected, overlapping, and sometimes competing agencies working for Angelenos. Although we know that close to 20% of L.A. County residents live in poverty, the actual needs of our communities are poorly understood. 

As a result, information about pressing issues such as demographic data, poverty statistics, educational needs, sub-ethnicities, and housing and health care scarcity is hidden—masked by the aggregate data of a huge population. 

Over recent years, there has been an effort to improve access to public data. While there is an increasing amount of public open data available throughout the region, it is often of poor quality, and can be very hard to find, even for seasoned data researchers and social change advocates. It is not open enough, not interoperable, transparent or standardized enough. 

Like the county itself, data about L.A. is potentially vibrant and rich, yet hampered by a lack of overall planning and centralized resources. The result is that major needs go untreated, promising solutions are overlooked and those with the greatest ability to help focus their efforts elsewhere.

Angelenos are aware of the issues and suffering facing L.A. County. They see it every day around them, yet when it comes to doing something about it, they do not know where to turn and what to do. A recent CCF, USC Dornsife and LA Times poll found that 80% of L.A. County residents are willing to increase their community involvement, but 40% say they don’t know what they can do to help or if it will make a difference. 

The rising profile of public open data as a tool for social change and government, in LA and elsewhere, creates an opportunity for a new type of solution, that combines access to good quality, standardized open data with impactful storytelling about the real unmet needs of L.A. County’s most vulnerable communities. 

Through the SCDC, we will chart the future of Los Angeles by telling its stories to all that can help create change, and we will find those stories in the numbers that describe and define the lives of Angelenos.


<h3>2. The Solution – Data for Advocacy, Advocacy for Data</h3>
SCDC is a different kind of data project, one that combines data access with powerful multimedia storytelling and advocacy to create positive social impact. Its purpose is twofold: 

+ to harness the power of open data to create a more equitable future for L.A. County’s most vulnerable and underserved communities, and
+ to encourage the creation and adoption of a gold standard for public open data.  

To do so, it will create an online resource promoting access to L.A. County’s open data (the Public Library), and to real, detailed stories of L.A. County (the Gateway blog). Users of these platforms will gather and generate insight into the challenges and solutions facing vulnerable populations in the region, as well as into the condition and availability of open data. This insight in turn will promote and encourage the adoption of better open data standards, and will help to foster change by giving philanthropic funders, donors and policymakers the tools to make better decisions for the future of L.A. County. 


<h1>II SCDC Concept</h1>

The SCDC will be the first regional, online public library of civic data and social change. As a central hub and champion for open civic data in L.A. County, it will harness the untapped potential of existing data resources and the talent and passion of data and social change advocates. 

It will allow people who understand the power of data and who seek to create social change in L.A. County to discover and analyze data sets, sources and resources; uncover connections and gaps in the available data; tell the stories behind it; share and discuss new data analyses, sources and opportunities; and inspire collaboration and advocacy to address L.A.’s most pressing challenges.

The project will unfold in two phases: 

**Phase One**

The first phase of SCDC will launch in the summer of 2017 and will include the following elements:

+ A **blog** for users to browse and share original content telling the stories of L.A. County’s most vulnerable communities and highlighting the most innovative and relevant solutions to those challenges, based on available data. Content will include:
  + user-created content drawing from the Public Library of data, 
  + original pieces from data-journalists and researchers, 
  + curated external web content on L.A. data and needs. 

The blog will be accessed through a Gateway which will also provide an overview of SCDC and an intuitive navigation tool linked to the other sections of the site. 

+ The **Public Library of L.A. Data** will be a central aggregator, curator and steward of links to and information about existing and emerging open data sets and sources for L.A. County. Users will explore a large library of data sources that will be structured by standard metadata standards—a library that will be searchable and easily navigable using broad categories (e.g. health, education or public safety) or specific tags, as well as usable for comparison across portals. Rather than hosting datasets on the site, the library will provide links to the data at their original sources, ensuring the most up-to-date available data. SCDC staff will add new sets, sources and resources as they become available. (Current Data Inventory can be accessed at [https://github.com/compilerla/los-angeles-data-sources](https://github.com/compilerla/los-angeles-data-sources)) 

Both elements will include an interactive community interface, allowing users to discuss data resources, content and issues, as well as ask and answer questions. We are looking to create an engaged community of users, who will use the site as a launchpad to share and advocate for solutions to the challenges faced by L.A. County’s most vulnerable communities. 

In the fall of 2017, a mini-suite will be launched hosting the Los Angeles Human Development Index (LAHDI). Compiled and created by Measure of America (MoA), it will provide a detailed look at the well-being of L.A. County residents, based on the UN Human Development Index. It will be co-branded by SCDC and MoA. 

The pages will contain customized analyses and visualizations designed to give viewers a detailed understanding of the issues affecting the day-to-day lives of Angelenos. It will also provide users with an introduction to and overview of Los Angeles using a detailed set of visualizations and content focused on the Los Angeles Human Development Index.

**Phase Two**

In its second phase, SCDC will launch its signature, community-driven forum, which will allow users to connect, share and work together to drive social change and to advance open data in L.A. County.

+ The Data Commons will be a public “maker space” that will capture the untapped civic engagement, potential and talent of users that have extraordinary ideas. It will be an empowering arena in which civic data users and advocates can share new data and/or generate new analyses by connecting and combining datasets in new and innovative ways. Users will explore a series of online communities centered around key areas of need in L.A. County (e.g. health, education, housing, economic opportunity and others); post questions, comments, link to new data sources and other relevant content; share data sets to be considered for inclusion in the Library of Data; and share, discuss, debate and collaborate to advocate for change on major issues affecting L.A. County.

<h2>A. SCDC Team </h2>
The SCDC is a project of The California Community Foundation, with the aim of eventually becoming a standalone nonprofit organization. The project is developed in collaboration with Compiler LA, a civic data consulting firm based in Los Angeles, and is managed by a dedicated full-time Project Manager working out of CCF’s Los Angeles offices. The SCDC Team will be exclusively responsible for content to be published on the site. 

<h2>B. Site Functionality and Technical Requirements</h2>
Site functionality is based on interviews with data advocates in our community. Using human-centered design and an agile approach, we expect that the precise priority and implementation of these features will change once a specific vendor is engaged (see **Appendix 1** for a detailed description of site functionality). Full technical requirements include specifics about accessibility, internationalization, public code, open source materials, hosting, analytics, and maintenance (**Appendix 2**). 

The key features we expect include a blog, support for d3.js visualizations throughout the site including blog, robust searching capabilities, ability to add and manage custom ontology, multiple user types, staff portal for administrative approvals of submitted content, and comments. We also expect to be able to consume specific content for the data library via API, for example, consuming metadata from an instance of the Socrata open data portal.

<h2>C.Minimum Inclusion Criteria for Data</h2>
One of the key components of the SCDC will be to promote a gold standard for open data. As such, we are committed to enforcing a clearly defined and easily followed minimum inclusion criteria for data. 
For data publishers seeking inclusion in the SCDC Data Library, the following minimum requirements must be met:

+ Dataset must be available online in an open and accessible way. 
+ Dataset must be available in a machine readable format.
+ Dataset documentation must comply with the minimum metadata requirements.

Data included in SCDC will meet the standard minimum inclusion criteria fields listed in the [W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) metadata standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/), which was chosen for SCDC as it already forms the basis of the [Project Open Data Metadata Schema v1.1](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) that was developed and adopted by the US Federal data.gov platform. Common adoption of metadata standards will facilitate comparison and federation of records across data portals. 

For more details, see appendices below: 

+ Minimum data requirements – Appendix 3
+ Metadata fields – Appendix 4
+ Current list of categories curated – Appendix 5
+ Dataset example – Appendix 6. 

<h2>D. Examples of related projects</h2>

**Data Storytelling**

The following sites reflect the vision we have for the stories SCDC would inspire, enable and publish: 

+ Chicago's Million Dollar Blocks – http://chicagosmilliondollarblocks.com/
+ Motor City Mapping – https://www.motorcitymapping.org/
+ New York Times Article – [Affluent and Black, and Still Trapped by Segregation](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/milwaukee-segregation-wealthy-black-families.html?_r=1)
+ Officer Involved - http://projects.scpr.org/officer-involved/ 

The following elements, as included in some or all of the stories, are particular relevant to our project:

+ data-driven 
+ contextual narrative or story
+ clear call to action
+ quickly and easily readable
+ relevant data visualization(s)
+ referencing to raw data and/or methodologies.


**Similar sites**

The following sites are a more direct reflection of what we envision the SCDC to be. In particular, the sites’ functionalities are a good illustration of the type of community engagement that we want to promote, although it has a different scope/focus. 

+ Community Commons - https://www.communitycommons.org/ 
+ Net Data Directory - http://netdatadirectory.org/ 

<h2>E. Audience</h2>
SCDC’s core target audience are those who understand the power of data to create social change in Los Angeles County. They come from a data background and are interested in social change or from a social change background and are interested in data. They are data literate, engaged and seek to better understand and make an impact on the needs of L.A. County. 


Different audience groups will access SCDC in different ways: while data advocates will typically use the Library of Data as a point of access for research, decision makers and donors will likely primarily use the Gateway and the blog as a source of information when making policy or funding decisions.

**Key User Profiles**

Name | Description 
------------ | -------------
Data Journalists | Print, radio or online journalist focusing on data analysis as a source for writing or contributing to news stories about L.A. County. 
Data Researchers | Academic researcher using data analysis as part of her research tools, often in the fields of social or human sciences. 
Civic Tech Activists | Civically engaged individual working in tech-related fields, familiar with data and willing to use their skills for social change. 
Policymakers | L.A. County and government employees with the authority to make policy decisions affecting Angelenos. Varying degrees of familiarity with data, but a willingness to tackle L.A. County’s challenges effectively. 
Service Providers | Nonprofit or government social service providers based in L.A. County, willing to learn more about the needs of the population they serve. 
Social Activists | Organizations working towards social justice and social change, conducting research and creating campaigns to affect policy decisions.  
Foundations | Philanthropic organizations looking for new and more efficient ways to donate and carry out their mission in L.A. County. 
Individual Donors | Generous individuals looking to donate money and make a real difference in L.A. County. 

Although the project in its initial phase will focus on users who are already in some way engaged in data and/or social change, our vision is to ultimately empower the broader community to become aware and engaged to the challenges L.A. County faces, and how they can help address them through charitable giving and innovation.

<h2>F. Measuring Success</h2>
The success of SCDC will ultimately relate to its twin objectives: using open data for advocacy, and advocating for access to open data. Success will therefore be measured in two ways:

+ by how successfully it is adopted and used to drive investment in and attention to pressing issues facing L.A. County residents, and 
+ by how it helps increase the quality and quantity of open data in Los Angeles County and beyond.

<h2>Appendix 3 – Defining Minimum Inclusion Criteria</h2>
For the purpose of this effort, a dataset is defined by the W3C as “A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats.” The regional landscape documents datasets, by collecting and maintaining metadata for each of these datasets. Metadata collected meet the minimum required fields of the [W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) metadata standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/). This standard was chosen as it already forms the basis of the [Project Open Data Metadata Schema v1.1](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) developed and adopted by the US Federal data.gov platform. Common adoption of metadata standards will facilitate comparison and federation of records across data portals. The properties in use and their definitions are listed in Appendix 4 – Metadata Requirements. 

We define “open data” as data that individuals and organizations make publicly available for use and/or redistribution without legal, technological or social restrictions. “Open data standards” are publicly available guidelines to improve data quality, accessibility and interoperability. Open data publishers do not require user information or payment; they do not implement restricted use cases or noncommercial clauses.

For data publishers seeking inclusion in the SCDC Data Library, the following minimum requirements must be met:

+ Dataset must be available online in an open and accessible way. 
+ Dataset must be available in a machine readable format.
+ Dataset documentation must comply with the minimum metadata requirements.
